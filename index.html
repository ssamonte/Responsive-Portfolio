      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I was born in Davao City, Philippines. 
          When I was 5 years old, I moved to Lilburn, GA and a few years later moved to Lawrenceville, GA.
          I now currently reside in Kennesaw, GA with my cat. I live by myself, but I love the peace and quiet.
      </p>
      <p> 
          I graduated from Southern Polytechnic State University in May 2015 with my
          Bachelors of Science in Industrial Engineering Technology with a minor in Business Administration.
          Along with my degrees, I also received my certification for Green Belt Six Sigma.
          Upon gradution, I started working as an accountant for a large dealership. I worked there for a little over a year.
          I was unhappy with my job, so I went on to pursue a career in Engineering, my first love. Soon after this realization, 
          I started to work for Jefferson Southern Corporation in Rockmart, GA as their Quality Engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
          My life is very consumed with work, as I am a very career oriented person. I have an amazing life otuside of work.
          I am your stereotypical girl, brunches on Sundays, shopping on the weekends, wine nights, and girl talk for hours at a time.
          I am a huge cat lover, as I currently have one. She is my fur child that's 14 years old. She's a little grumpy, but once she
          warms up to you, she is the biggest cupcake ever.
